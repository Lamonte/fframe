IMPORTANT TODO
---------------

- Manage Roles - basically a section in the admin panel where you can create new roles then edit the permissions that
each role can have.  Which also means it would be a good time to add a description field to the permissions database table for each new permission.  Also need a proper naming system for the permissions ie: admin_role_create, user_profile_edit etc...

- Manage Users - after I finish setting up roles, this should be added directly after CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
without the C.  Also regarding deleting people, there will be roles for updating, deleting peoples account just so people
won't abuse it.

- Manage Forums - going to be neat, there aren't any categories just parent forums and sub forums.  Ordering will use
basic javascript with up and down arrows on each forum which moves a forum up or down.  I feel that's the easiest way
to combat forum ordering instead of weird drop down select the order bs if that makes sense.  Also forums with url redirects can't have children forums.  Can still be ordered.
	
	- forum permissions - which roles can CRUD threads in this forum 

- Update validation class so you can mask input names in error messages to something more presentable to the user via some sort of 
array setting.

- editing and deleting non default permission pages

- when I get to the forum view page I'm going to need to have a way to route urls to certain actions because by default if people
want to view forum they would have to visit: example.com/forum/view/id instead of just example.com/forum/id, but viewing threads
will be straight to the point not sure if i want threads to have their own action page or have them combined with forum action
ie. example.com/forum/thread/id or just example.com/thread/id which would mean the url masking would flexible - i could borrow
the code i already wrote for my new framework though.

- create an elegant forum index theme and admin panel theme

- add admin directory to the config file, that way we can have our code even more flexible for lets say wanting to change
the path to the administration panel for safe keeping from asshats

- keep all variables within the same if/else scope with the same tab spacing between the equal signs (must line up in same if/else scope)

- figure out a better versioning system lol

WHATS DONE?
----------------
- Permission Role Class - allows users to have many roles (or groups for what it's worth) and each role can be signed to
many permissions which is great.  Allows for a lot of flexibility with permissions throughout the system.  Also custom
roles can be easily done in the future especially with the role/permission editor that will be added.

- Basic Authentication - users can register and login, registration is limited to username and password for now which
will be expanded soon.

- Basic MVC - action classes (controller) auto load view files based on the page - then from there we have just normal
classes that we load for handling database things.  Which basically is an include file.  Also as for the basic url
schema: /action/page/paramN+/, basically just like a MVC url schema.  Only problem I foresee is viewing forum indexes
may need to setup custom routing.

- Viewing and Creating Permissions

- /ADMIN/ - need find the best way to approach the way we access the admin panel, a lot of current forum softwares use
the admin forum and it's basically saying okay lets reenact the way our framework already runs, except now we're under
a different sub path that you have to worry about.  Wondering if I could do something like this without changing to much
core code.
